          The Montessori Company is the brainchild of Michelle Rugel,
          an AMI-trained guide and the Head of School at Hiatt Farms
          Montessori. Michelle received her M.Ed. from Loyola University and
          was trained as an elementary guide by Kay Baker at the
          Washington Montessori Institute. She taught in an elementary
          classroom in Chicago and helped to organize a new Montessori
          environment in Switzerland before moving to Puebla, Mexico for
          her AMI primary training under Coral Ruiz. From 2014-2016 she served
          as a primary guide at the Montessori Academy Bangkok International
          School in Thailand before moving to Denver, CO where she is
          studying with Judi Orion in the AMI Assistants
          to Infancy program for the summer. Her primary school at Hiatt
          Farms is scheduled to open in 2018.
