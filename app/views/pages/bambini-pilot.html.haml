            Welcome to the Bambini pilot! We are very excited about
            helping guides, teachers and day cares share their most precious
            moments with parents in a safe and secure space.
          %p
            As a member of the Bambini pilot group you will have access to
            Bambini for FREE for six months starting immediately
            after we launch the first version. You will be instrumental in
            helping us craft the first set of features to optimize the
            experience for both educators and parents.
          %p
            Since Bambini will be a long-term and expensive project we're using
            pilot registrations as a general measure of interest. If you know
            anyone who may be interested in joining please share the concept
            and this webpage! We will only proceed with the pilot if we
            receive enough sign-ups. Thank you and we look forward to working
            with you!

                  By submitting this form you agree to participate in the
                  Bambini pilot program, collaborating with The Montessori
                  Company to fine-tune and improve Bambini by providing
                  regular feedback about your experience.

                  Participation will require a small but important setup process
                  at the beginning, to include importing your student roster
                  and installing the Bambini application on mobile devices.
                  You will be responsible for any necessary communications
                  explaining Bambini to staff and parents.
                  The Montessori Company will provide example
                  language and hands-on support throughout the pilot to
                  ensure a wonderful experience for everyone involved!
